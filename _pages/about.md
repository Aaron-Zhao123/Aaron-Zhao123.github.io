# Quick Bio

I am an Assistant Professor at Imperial College London ([Department wiki](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.zhao) and [Lab wiki](https://deepwok.github.io/)). 
I am also a co-founded at the [AI Sequrity Company](https://sequrity.ai/)). 
In my academic research, I focus on Efficient AI related topics - from new algorithmic designs to building AI accelerators. At my startup work, I am currently building the first secure AI agentic flows.

Prior to that, I was a Research Fellow at [St John's College](https://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/), University of Cambridge. I had my PhD studies at the [Computer Lab of the University of Cambridge](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/), supervised by [Prof. Robert Mullins](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rdm34/), and I also finished an MPhil degree in the same lab.
Before that, I obtained my [Electrical and Electronic Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/electrical-engineering/) BEng degree from the Imperial College London with my final two years supervised by [Prof. George Constantinides](https://cas.ee.ic.ac.uk/people/gac1/). During my BEng studies, I was tutored by [Dr. Papavassiliou](https://cas.ee.ic.ac.uk/people/dario/).

I have previously worked at various placements and have taken part-time research positions at Microsoft Research and Apple AI/ML.
I sometimes review and serve as Area Chairs for several hardware, system, and machine learning conferences, including ICLR, ICML, NeurIPS, CVPR, etc.

I was a recipient of the Junior Research Fellowship at St John’s College, the University of Cambridge in 2021, and was awarded as an Apple Scholar in AI and ML in 2020.
