# Reserach

My research focuses on the intersections between hardware, algorithms, and security in the Machine Learning world. I am generally interested in making Machine Learning systems fast, reliable and efficient. Some of my research topics include:

* How do novel hardware architectures improve the efficiency of running ML workloads?
* How to tweak current ML algorithms to make them more efficient on today and future hardware systems?
ML security-related topics with a hardware spin.
* What should the next-generation data-orientated learning system look like?

See advice [for students](/wiki/students) (this includes internships, undergraduate or master projects, and PhD applicants), and information for collaborators, if you want to contact me for study or collaborations.

# Quick Bio

I am an Assistant Professor at Imperial College London.

Prior to that, I was a Junior Research Fellow at St John's College, University of Cambridge. I had my PhD studies at the Computer Lab of the University of Cambridge, supervised by Prof. Robert Mullins. I finished my MPhil degree from Cambridge and was supervised by Prof. Robert Mullins as well. Before that, I obtained my Electrical and Electronic Engineering BEng degree from the Imperial College London with my final two years supervised by [Prof. George Constantinides](https://cas.ee.ic.ac.uk/people/gac1/). During my BEng studies, I was tutored by [Dr. Papavassiliou](https://cas.ee.ic.ac.uk/people/dario/).

I review for several hardware, system, and machine learning conferences, including ICLR, ICML, NeurIPS, CVPR, etc.

I was a recipient of the Junior Research Fellowship at St John’s College, the University of Cambridge in 2021, and was awarded as an Apple Scholar in AI and ML in 2020.
