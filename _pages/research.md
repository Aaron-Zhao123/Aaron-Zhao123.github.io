# Reserach

My research focuses on the intersections between hardware, algorithms, and security in the Machine Learning world. I am generally interested in making Machine Learning systems fast, reliable and efficient. Some of my research topics include:

* How do novel hardware architectures improve the efficiency of running ML workloads?
* How to tweak current ML algorithms to make them more efficient on today and future hardware systems?
ML security-related topics with a hardware spin.
* What should the next-generation data-orientated learning system look like?

See advice [for students](/students) (this includes internships, undergraduate or master projects, and PhD applicants), and information for collaborators, if you want to contact me for study or collaborations.

I lead the [DeepWok Lab](https://deepwok.github.io/), and most of the research related updates are in the lab wiki.
