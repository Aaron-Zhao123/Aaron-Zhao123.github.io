## Labs

Labs are hosted on [MASE Wiki](https://deepwok.github.io/mase/modules/labs.html#)

## Assessment Information

The assessment contains two practicals (15% each), and a team project with two people (70%).
If you used Colab Pro, we are wiling to reimburse that cost, please keep a copy of your receipt.

##### Practical 1 Submission (15%)

 - Deadline (5th Feb, submission on BlackBoard): **A Markdown file**: with all answers (plots, tables ...) of the questions and optional questions in Lab 1 and Lab2. The file should be named as `practical1_your_college_short_code.md` (eg. `practical1_yz10513.md`). 
 - Corresponding code in your forked repository (will be checked in the lab oral, no submission needed). But you can include code snippets in the submitted markdown file.
 - Deadline (TBC, but around 5th Feb) **Lab Oral**.

##### Practical 2 Submission (15%)

 - Deadline (5th Feb, submission on BlackBoard): **A Markdown file**: with all answers (plots, tables ...) of the questions and optional questions in Lab 3 and Lab4. The file should be named as `practical2_your_college_short_code.md` (eg. `practical2_yz10513.md`). 
 - Corresponding code in your forked repository (will be checked in the lab oral, no submission needed). But you can include code snippets in the submitted markdown file.
 - Deadline (TBC, but around 5th Feb) **Lab Oral**.

##### Team Project (70%)

- [Team making proposal link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1atlb43T8x6Gv5idg0eupLlW1REFDdblw3pBgsSWci7E/edit?usp=sharing)
- A roadmap meeting with a GTA (not assessed).
- Deadline (18th March): **A show me your code lab oral** (assessed).  
- Deadline (28th March): **Coursework code submission** as a pull request on Github (assessed). The PR should also have a clear documentation of the functionality that you have implemented and its corresponding tests. The tests should be integrated into the existing testing framework.
- Deadline (28th March, PDF attached in the PR): **8-page Report** (assessed). The report should mainly focus on an evaluation of your implementation. The description of functionality and testing has being described in the PR already, so this 8-page report should include the experiments you have designed to explore certain trade-offs and properties of your optimization.
