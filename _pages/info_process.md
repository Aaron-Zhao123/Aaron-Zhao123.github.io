# Information Processing (InfoProc)

Course code: ELEC50009

The aim of the module is to enable students to design information processing systems of medium complexity, by considering communication and computation costs, as well as local (embedded) and server-side processing. The module builds upon the material you have been taught in your EIE year two, and introduces the practical aspects of embedded processing, networking, and databases. The first part of the module consists of a series of practical labs where you will be exposed to the practical aspects of embedded processing, networking and datasets, followed by a practical component (i.e. coursework) with strong emphasis on the design methodology, where a fully operational processing system needs to be designed.

Upon successful completion of this module, you will be able to:

1. Develop an embedded system based on a CPU/FPGA
2. Apply signal processing. techniques to a time-series data considering their computational cost
3. Develop the communication infrastructure between a local node and a server
4. Design a database that communicates with the rest of the system
5. Judge the compute capabilities of different platform

This course is lab-based.

## Important dates

- 6th Jan, Group Registration, group members must be from the same cohort (Group A or B)
- 13th Jan, Group Registration ends
- 12th Feb, Mid-term lab oral (20%), Q\&As **as a group**, for contents in all the labs
- 11th and 13th March, Demo showcase, final lab oral
- 21st March, Final Report (80%, this is aggregated and evaluated also based on the demo quality and final lab oral)
