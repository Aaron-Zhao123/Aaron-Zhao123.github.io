1. [What's New](#new)
2. [Summer Research Placement](#placement)
3. [Student Projects (PartII, III, Mphil, FYP and MSc)](#project)
4. [PhD opportunities](#phd)

Each year, we run and supervise a number of students for their undergraduate and master projects at Imperial College London and the University of Cambridge. We also run a great number of summer research internships.

I am very proud that many of these projects/placements lead to publication(s) at the end, even with our first/second year undergraduate students.

## What's new? <a name="new"></a>

* Updated my PartII, III and MPhil projects (2022-2023) proposals (last updated 27/12/2022) at the [Deepwok page](https://deepwok.github.io/). Please check this link if you are interested in having a UROP project (Research summer internship) with us. This is only for cambridge students. (last updated 27/12/2022)

## Research placement (non-PhD level) <a name="placement"></a>

I offer paid undergraduate summer internships, but they will have to be undergraduates from either Imperial College London or the University of Cambridge (I didn’t make these restrictions, the university did!). I can consider remote undergraduate summer interns, but these will not be paid due to UK tax laws.

The list of possible projects are at [Deepwok](https://deepwok.github.io/), I am also happy to discuss self-proposed ideas!

## Final Year Project, MSc Project, Part II/III Project and Mphil Project <a name="project"></a>

If you are a student at the University of Cambridge and are interested in doing a Part II, III, or Mphil Project with me, please throw me an email, and see an incomplete project suggestions below (email me for more proposals or propose your own project!).

If you are a student at Imperial College London and are interested in doing an Undergraduate or Master’s Project with me, please throw me an email, and see an incomplete project suggestions below (email me for more proposals or propose your own project!).

It is worth to mention that my research interests are broad and not 100% hardware focused, I do a lot of work in the ML algorithm space focusing on AutoML, Security and graph learning.

## PhD opportunities <a name="phd"></a>

PhD funding is competitive, especially for international students.
I suggest the student look at the following general advice before contacting me for PhD applications.

**General advice**

* Applications for PhD are competitive. Unless you have a 1st class degree or a high 2/1 degree + a 1st class project, it is unlikely that you will be accepted by our group. MEng or BEng + MSc is preferable to BEng only.

* Applications for PhD funding are more competitive. If you have a BSc or a BEng from inside or outside Imperial College, you will need a good track record on publications.

* You should always question yourself about ‘is doing a PhD worth it‘ before even going into an application process.

**Funding**

Imperial College London have several funding channels:

* President’s PhD Schorlarship (Very competitive)
* Electrical & Electronic Engineering PhD Scholarships (You will need to contact me beforehand)
* China Scholarship Council

In general, funding for international students are very competitive.

**What I am looking for from you?**

I am looking for students that are

* motivated;
* had demonstrated their studying skills in fields like Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, and Engineering;
* have either a strong coding background or a strong math background.

Feel free to contact me if you are interested in joining my group.

**PhD in AI/ML and What does it mean by working with me?**

I will describe what does ML research mean to me and how I can help students in different ways.

I am actively writing code, in both software and hardware, and am happy to help people (including students) to debug.
I have a wide range of collaborations with researchers of different backgrounds and am always happy to refer students to my collaborators. I enjoyed doing a lot of placements/internships during my PhD and I would strongly suggest other PhDs to do the same given that they are on track.
I am not interested in helping you become an ‘engineer’ or ‘technician’, I would strongly encourage students to bounce ideas around and hopefully can become independent researchers at the end.
I am generally very chilled and am open to any research ideas.
